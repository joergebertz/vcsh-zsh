# .zprofile is similar to .zlogin, except that it is sourced before .zshrc.
# .zprofile is meant as an alternative to `.zlogin' for ksh fans; the two are
# not intended to be used together, although this could certainly be done if
# desired. 
#
# Files are read in this order:
# .zshenv. /etc/zprofile .zprofile. /etc/zshrc .zshrc /etc/zlogin .zlogin
